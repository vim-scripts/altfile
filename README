Suppose we have a project which resides in a "proj" directory. Content of that directory might look like this:

  proj/classes/Class1.php
  proj/classes/Class2.php
  proj/classes/Namespace/Class3.php
  proj/tpl/Class1.html
  proj/tpl/Class2.html
  proj/tpl/Namespace/Class3.html
  proj/tests/Class1.phpt
  proj/tests/Class2.phpt
  proj/tests/Namespace/Class3.phpt

Create "proj/.altfile" and put these lines inside:

  class: classes/{MATCH}.php
  template: tpl/{MATCH}.html
  test: tests/{MATCH}.phpt

Now load "proj/classes/Class1.php" and hit the hot key. Menu will
appear:

  class  [template]  test

Now you can use it as any other wild menu: cursor keys, <CR>, <Esc>.

By default previously active item is highilighted (works like Alt-Tab for Windows or Cmd-Tab for Mac OS X). So, to quickly switch between two files all you have to do is <M-Tab><CR>.

Now load "proj/tpl/Class4.html" - it does not exist, and you'll get empty window. Hit <M-Tab>, select "class" and hit <CR> - VIM will create new buffer for (still non-existing) "proj/classes/Class4.php". Ta-dah! Actually, this is my main reason for creating this plugin.

Note that it DOES NOT matter what is your current directory: you can cd to whatever place you want. But it DOES matter where ".altfile" is, becase patterns inside it are relative to its placement.

To show visual file selector hit <F3>. Use movement/cursor keys to highlight a file; <CR> loads file; <Tab> switches between labels.
